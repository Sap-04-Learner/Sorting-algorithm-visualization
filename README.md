# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This Django project provides a comprehensive visualization of various sorting algorithms. Each algorithm has its own dedicated webpage with detailed information and visualization tools. Additionally, there is a comparison page that shows the performance of different sorting algorithms on the same array. This project is designed to help users understand the behavior and performance characteristics of various sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Algorithm Pages:** Each sorting algorithm has its own webpage containing:
  - **Description:** Detailed explanation of the algorithm.
  - **Advantages:** Benefits of using the algorithm.
  - **Disadvantages:** Limitations of the algorithm.
  - **Animated Video:** Visualization of the sorting process.
  - **Code Snippet:** Copyable code to implement the algorithm.
  - **Time Complexity Graph:** Graphical representation of the time complexity.

  
- **Comparison Page:** A dedicated page for comparing sorting algorithms:

  - **Performance Comparison:** Displays the time taken by each sorting algorithm to sort the same array.
  - **Static Graph:** A graph comparing the performance of all sorting algorithms.


Thank you for using the Sorting Algorithm Visualization project! We hope it helps you better understand sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics.
